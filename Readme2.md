Create a README file in your repository that, at a minimum, includes the following:
A table of contents for your repository
A description of the dataset
An overview of the key insights from your project
A non-technical explanation of your regression model, including most important features.
A list of concepts / skill keywords you used in the project (think: words a recruiter might be looking for)


1. TOC:
      Project-2-Peterson.ipynb -> Jupyter nb, with all code, comments, etc.
      README.md -> Original instructions for assignment

2. Data

      Taken from the Iowa liquor database, this data describes sales for each
      liquor store in the state of Iowa, by month, and by product.

3. Insights

      From this data it became apparent that trying to predict a variable highly
      correlated with reggressed variables without running into problems of
      colliniearity is all but impossible

4. Regression

      I attempted to build a model that modeled sales upon "thirst", "convenience"
      and "Luxury", of each city and county.

Data Munging was the greatest part of this project.
